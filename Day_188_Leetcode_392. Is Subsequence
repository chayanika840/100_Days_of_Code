/* Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        if (s.isEmpty())
      return true;

    int i = 0;
    for (final char c : t.toCharArray())
      if (s.charAt(i) == c && ++i == s.length())
        return true;

    return false;
    }
}
