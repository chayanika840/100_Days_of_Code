#Sort the People

#You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.

For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.

Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

Example 1:

Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.

class Solution:
    def sortPeople(self, names: List[str], heights: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        return list(a for a, b in sorted(zip(names, heights),key=lambda x: -x[1]))
        
        #if we put the value of x: x[1] a straight simple seedha list is printed but when we do x: -x[1] reverse of the list is printed in  a sorted order.
